the solution is: there is canary  but the canary value not generating from system but from the program, ```the canary value = (printf libc address ^ 0x123456789abcdef1)``` so if i leaked canary value and xored it with 0x123456789abcdef1 , i got the real address of printf and i can leak libc base address and call one gadget to get a shell
